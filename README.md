## GitHub Notes

Branch Names should follow this format `[your initials]/[todays-date]/[scope-of-your-branch]` --> `DV/4-25-23/update-readme`

Be sure to run `dart format` to get your changes to pass the workflow checks.

When writing tests, using the file naming convention `*_test.dart` e.g. `waitlist_button_test.dart`, otherwise the test package may not run your tests.
